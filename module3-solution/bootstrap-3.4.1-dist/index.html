                        <p>
                            Gulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun) is a milk-solid-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent, and a type of mithai, popular in India, Nepal, Pakistan (where it is known as gulab jamun), the Maldives (where it is known as gulaabujaanu), and Bangladesh (where it is known as gulab jam), as well as Myanmar. It is also common in nations with substantial populations of people with South Asian heritage, such as Mauritius, Fiji, the Malay Peninsula, Great Britain, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries of Trinidad and Tobago, (where it is called rasgulla), Guyana, and Suriname. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts such as almonds and cashews to enhance flavour.In the Indian subcontinent, milk and cheese solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame for a long time until the water content has evaporated and only the milk solids remain. These milk solids, known as khoya, are kneaded into a dough, with a small amount of flour (maida), and then shaped into small balls and deep-fried in oil or ghee (clarified butter) at a low temperature of about 148 °C until they get their familiar golden brown color. If the balls are cooked quickly, they will be raw on the inside. The fried balls are then soaked in a light sugar syrup flavored with green cardamom and rose water, kewra or saffron.Gulab jamun was first prepared in medieval India and was derived from a fritter that Central Asian Turkic invaders brought to India. Other theory claims that it was accidentally prepared by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan's personal chef.The word "Gulab" is derived from the Persian words gol (flower) and āb (water), referring to the rose water-scented syrup. "Jamun" or "jaman" is the Hindi word for Syzygium jambolanum, an Indian fruit with a similar size and shape, commonly known as black plum. Jamun is also defined as a fried delicacy in sugar syrup. The Arab dessert luqmat al-qadi is similar to gulab jamun, although it uses a different batter. According to the culinary historian Michael Krondl, both luqmat al-qadi and gulab jamun may have derived from a Persian dish, with rose water syrup being a common connection between the two.

                        <p>
                            Ras malai or rossomalai is a dessert originating from the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, possibly Bengal. The name ras malai is the Hindi cognate of Bengali: rosh, meaning "juice", and malai, meaning "cream". It has been described as "a rich cheesecake without a crust". The sweet is of Bengali origin; according to K.C. Das Grandsons, it was invented by K.C. Das. It is also a popular dessert in Pakistan.It is believed to have originated somewhere in Eastern India, presumably in the Bengal region. The K.C. Das Grandsons confectioners claims that it was invented by K.C. Das, but this claim is said to be "impossible to verify".According to The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink published by Oxford University Press "The term comes from Hindi raś 'juice', and malai 'cream'.Ras malai consists of flattened balls of chhana soaked in malai (clotted cream) flavoured with cardamom. Milk is boiled and a bit of vinegar or lime juice is added to split it. The whey is discarded and the milk solids are drained, cooled and kneaded into a dough. The dough is divided into small balls and the balls are cooked in hot water with a bit of rose water added. The balls are then cooked in milk with saffron, pistachios and kheer as stuffing.

                        <p>
                            Rasgulla or Rosogolla is an Indian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.The dish originated in East India; the present-day states of Odisha and West Bengal have variously claimed to be its birthplace. In 2015, a committee formed by the government of Odisha asserted that the sweet had originated in Odisha, where it is offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple. In 2016, the West Bengal government applied for a Geographical Indications (GI) tag for the variant called "Banglar Rosogolla" (Bengali Rasgulla) or normal Rasgulla, clarifying that the Bengal and Odisha variants were different in "both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing."In 2017, when West Bengal got its Rosogolla's GI status, the Registry office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar Rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they site the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.In 2018, Odisha government applied for GI status for "Odisha Rasagola" (Odia Rasgulla was declared different from normal Rasgulla), which got approved by GI Registry of India and subsequently Odisha got its own Rasagola's GI status on 29 July 2019.
